# You have n candies, the ith candy is of type candies[i].
#
# You want to distribute the candies equally between a sister and a brother so that each of them gets n / 2 candies (n is even). The sister loves to collect different types of candies, so you want to give her the maximum number of different types of candies.
#
# Return the maximum number of different types of candies you can give to the sister.
#
#
#
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
# Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
# The sister has three different kinds of candies. 
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
# The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: candies = [1,1]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: candies = [1,11]
# Output: 1
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: candies = [2,2]
# Output: 1
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	n == candies.length
# 	2 <= n <= 10^4
# 	n is even.
# 	-10^5 <= candies[i] <= 10^5
#
