# Invert a binary tree.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   2     7
#  / \   / \
# 1   3 6   9
#
# Output:
#
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   7     2
#  / \   / \
# 9   6 3   1
#
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        q = []
        q.append(root)
        while q:
            current = q.pop()
            if current:
                current.left, current.right = current.right, current.left
                q.append(current.left)
                q.append(current.right)
