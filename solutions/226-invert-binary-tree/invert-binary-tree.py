# Invert a binary tree.
#
# Example:
#
# Input:
#
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   2     7
#  / \   / \
# 1   3 6   9
#
# Output:
#
#
#      4
#    /   \
#   7     2
#  / \   / \
# 9   6 3   1
#
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
